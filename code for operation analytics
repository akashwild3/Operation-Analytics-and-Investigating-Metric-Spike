A.	Number of jobs reviewed: Amount of jobs reviewed over time. task: Calculate the number of jobs reviewed per hour per day for November 2020? 
SELECT 
    COUNT(DISTINCT job_id)/(30*24) 
FROM job_data WHERE 
    ds BETWEEN ‘2020-11-01’ AND ‘2020-11-30’ 
    
    
    

B.	Throughput: It is the no. of events happening per second. 
task: Let’s say the above metric is called throughput. Calculate 7 day rolling average of throughput? For throughput, do you prefer daily metric or 7-day rolling and why? 
SELECT ds, event_per_day, 
 AVG(event_per_day)OVER(ORDER BY ds ROWS BETWEEN 6 PRECEDING AND 
CURRENT ROW)AS 7_day_rolling_avg FROM 
(SELECT ds, COUNT(DISTINCT event) AS event_per_day 
FROM job_data WHERE  
    ds BETWEEN ‘2020-11-01’ AND ‘2020-11-30’ 
GROUP BY ds 
ORDER BY ds)a 



c.Percentage share of each language: Share of each language for different contents. task: Calculate the percentage share of each language in the last 30 days? 
 
SELECT language, 100.0* num_jobs/total_jobs AS pct_share 
FROM 
( 
SELECT language, COUNT(DISTINCT job_id) AS num_jobs 
FROM job_data 
GROUP BY  
Language)a 
CROSS JOIN  
( 
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT job_id) AS total_jobs 
FROM job_data)b 
ORDER BY pact_share DESC 



D. Duplicate rows: Rows that have the same value present in them. 
task: Let’s say you see some duplicate rows in the data. How will you display duplicates from the table? 
 
SELECT *  
FROM  
( SELECT *, 
ROW_NUMBER()OVER(PARTITION  BY job_id) AS rownum 
FROM job_data 
)a 
WHERE rownum > 1
